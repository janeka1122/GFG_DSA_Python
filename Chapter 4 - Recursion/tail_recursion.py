# TAIL RECURSION

'''
Tail recursive functions are optimized b modern compilers.
A function is tail recursive if no operation other than function calling 
are performed by caller
'''

# Optimization done by most modern compilers (C,C++,Java etc)
# This optimization is called Tail Call Optimization
# However, Python does not have this optimization built into it

# Examples of Tail Recursive Functions
# 1. Quick Sort
# 2. Postorder Tree Traversal
